TreeLearn will one day be an ensemble decision tree learning library for Python. For now, however, the only base classifier is a randomized tree and the only ensemble is Breiman's Random Forest. For more information on this learning algorithm, see http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/. 

## Creating a RandomForest

To create a random foest using default parameters:
    forest = RandomForest()

Optional parameters:

 * base_classifier = any classifier which obeys the fit/predict protocol, defaults to a RandomizedTree 

 * num_classifiers = size of the forest 
 
 * bag_percent = what percentage of your data each individual classifier is trained on

## RandomizedTree options 
    
 * num_features_per_node = number of features each node of a tree should consider. (default = log2 of total features)
    
 * min_leaf_size = stop splitting if we get down to this number of data points 

 * max_height = stop splitting if we exceed this number of tree levels

 * max_thresholds = how many feature value thesholds to consider (use None to consider all values)

## Training

Place your training data in a n-by-d numpy array, where n is the number of training examples and d is the dimensionality of your data. Place labels in an n-length numpy array. Then call: 

    forest.fit(Xtrain,Y)


## Classification

    forest.predict(Xtest)
